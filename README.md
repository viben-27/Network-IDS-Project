# Network-IDS-Project

Overview

This project demonstrates a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) using Suricata.
It showcases:

Writing custom detection rules

Generating simulated attack traffic

Monitoring real-time alerts in JSON logs

This project is ideal for understanding network security monitoring, building a resume-ready demo, and creating a foundation for full IDS/log monitoring pipelines.
